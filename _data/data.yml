               over the Indian Ocean and the Maritime Continent (2015–2018)
        #link: "#hook"
        
        tagline: "Analyzed the simulations of the MJO activity performed with the atmospheric model Meso-NH and compared them 
        with TRMM satellite data (data analysis and visualisation was done with NCL)."

        #link: "#"
        
        tagline: "Participated in the development of the analytical method for describing the impact consequences of
        the collisions of cosmic bodies with the surface of a planet. Wrote the code in Matlab for the application of this method 
        to real meteoroid data."

      - title: Review and analytical investigation of the influence of roughness and blowing on the turbulent boundary layer (2012–2013)
      
        tagline: "Made a review of different approaches for simulation the boundary layer on a flat plate with a rough surface. 
        Proposed a hypothesis for the modification of the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model in case of blowing."
        
      - title: Transition to chaotic motions in penetrative convection (2007-2012)
